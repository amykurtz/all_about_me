    <h1>Amy Kurtz</h1>
    <p>My name is Amy. I am an 18 year old student at BYU studying cybersecurity. Scroll to learn about my interest in music, hobbies, and fun facts.<p>
    
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <div class="music">
        <p>I play 2 instruments, starting when I was five. I started out on piano and played til I was 16, 
        playing competitively for the last two years. I once won a scholarship for a couple hundred dollars.
        In middle school I started doing band. I played trumpet then switched to French horn.
        I now march in the Cougar Marching Band at BYU and as a whole have done band for 8 years.<p></div>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <div class="hobbies">
        <p>Over the past year I have picked up crocheting. My favorite project was making a stuffed turtle.
        I also enjoy hiking and camping. My family travels to Cascade, ID every summer and camps on the lake for a few days.
        I have also gotten into thrifting over the years. My favorite things to thrift are ugly t-shirts and sweaters.
        When I'm feeling spendy I enjoy live music and concerts as well. The best concert I've been to was Clairo.<p></div>

    <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
    <div class="Fun-Facts">
        <p>1. I am allergic to peanuts and tree nuts. People like to ask me how I found out. I found out the hard way.</p>
        <p>2. I was born in rural Tennessee, in a little town called Kodak. When I was 5, my family moved to Meridian, ID. I lived there for most of my life so far. I now live in Utah for school.</p>
        <p>3. This summer, I got my notary commission for the state of Idaho. I got it because it was required for my work. The extra money is nice, but I'm scared I'm going to be sued for doing it wrong.</p>
